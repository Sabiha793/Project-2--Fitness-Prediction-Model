# Project-2--Fitness-Prediction-Model
Fitness prediction Model Using Machine Learning
Train and evaluate a variety of ML algorithms on the data, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting.
Use cross-validation to assess the performance of each model, focusing on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or ROC-AUC to ensure robust comparison.
